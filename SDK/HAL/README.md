### `The program runs in external Flash`

To run the program in external Flash, you first need to download a Bootloader, initialize QSPI peripherals, and map QSPI Flash to 0x90000000

1. Download the routine 02, which is a Bootloader running outside the program, using the WeAct Studio Download Tool to Download the hex file from the project using USB, or run it directly by compiling keil

2. Add the external Flash download algorithm by referring to the README in the folder `QSPI_Flasher`

3. Routine 03, select externally run Target with W25Qxx, 0_96 for 0.96 inch TFT, 1_8 for 1.8 inch TFT, compile run download
