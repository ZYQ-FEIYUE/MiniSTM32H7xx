## DCMI 2 LCD

Collected in the camera image displayed on the LCD, support OV7725 OV7670, OV2640, OV5640

> When using long wire extension, OV7725 XCLK clock adopts MCO1 output, which may be abnormal. 12Mhz square wave clock can be generated by using `TIM1 Channel 1` PWM mode. However, after using TIM1 to output XCLK clock, it conflicts with the BACKlight PWM of LCD

> OV5640 auto focus is not implemented
